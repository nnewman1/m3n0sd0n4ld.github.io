## Exploitation

#### Exploit used: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47799 ](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47799)

We see is working! 

![](3.png)

We transfer the **netcat** to the machine, listen on port *443* and run a **netcat** on the victim to get an interactive session.

We try to read the *root.txt* flag, but we don't have access, so we only read the *user.txt* flag.

## Privilege Escalation
We see the privileges, we identify the famous "*SeImpersonatePrivilege*", but I can already tell you that the machine seems to be patched.

We also identify the operating system and its architecture.

We download the "**Winpeas**" tool, identify a software called "**OpenClinic**" and a "**Tomcat 8**".

There is a local exploit for privilege escalation:
#### Exploit used: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50448](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50448)

We create a malicious binary with "**msfvenom**" with a reverse shell to our machine on port 5555.
![](9.png)

Transfer the malicious binary, rename the file "**mysqld.exe**" to "**mysqld.bak**" and replace the malicious binary with "**mysqld.exe**".
![](10.png)

We set our **netcat** to listen on port 5555 and restart the victim machine.
![](11.png)

In a few minutes, we will get a connection on our machine and as the user "*nt authority system*".

Finally, we will read the flag from *root.txt*.
