### Level: `Easy` | OS: `Linux`

## Scanning
We performed an **nmap** scan, including all ports and software versions.

## Enumeration
We access the web resource on a high port.

On *port 16109*, it shows an image. This is a CTF, it is possible that this image contains stego, so we download it.

## Exploitation
We run the **steghide** tool without password and get a file containing credentials.

It seems to be very easy, we try the credentials obtained in the **SSH** service and get access to the machine.

Recall that we had enumerated a **MySQL**, we tried to access with the **default credentials** with success, we enumerated the *"Users"* table, we enumerated the password of the user *"ramen"* and another *flag*.

We authenticate as the user *"ramen"*, but it seems that we will not be able to do much with it.

## Privilege Escalation
We launch the tool **lse.sh**, we enumerate the *Screen 4.5.0 binary*, I already knew this binary, it has an **[exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154)** to escalate privileges.

![](12.png)

In my case I did it manually, so I compiled the *"libhax.so"* and *"rootshell"* files in my Kali, mounted a server with **Python** to share the files and executed the following commands to escalate privileges to the *root* user.

#### Some of the flags found (My idea was just to root the machine)
