## Scanning
We launch a previous nmap to all ports and launch again an **nmap** with services and scripts to these ports.

## Enumeration
We access the website, we see that we need a username and password to access what looks like a printer administration panel.

We use the credentials "*admin:admin*" and access the printer control panel. We also enumerate the *driver.htb* domain, we put it in our "**/etc/hosts**" file.

## Exploitation

We upload a reverse shell in **PHP** and see that it accepts it.

After trying to upload a file to obtain command execution, we see that it does not work.

So, reading the statement, it says "*share*", so it occurred to me to look for information about drivers and samba, I found information about the use of "**.scf**" files (*Shell Command File)*.

We run "**responder.py**" and upload the file. 
The idea is as follows:
- The machine, will execute the file upload by searching our SMB resource.
- When accessing our resource, it should show the hash "**NTLMv2**".
- We will crack the NTLMv2 hash to get the plain password, as these hashes are not usable for passthehash.

#### Burp request

#### Capture NTLMv2 Hash with Responder.py

We crack the password with the "**rockyou**" dictionary.

We connect to "**evil-winrm**" and read the flag from *user.txt*.

## Privilege Escalation
I didn't bother if there was an alternative route to climbing. Since the machine is called "**Driver**" and uses "**Windows**", I directly escalated privileges by exploiting the "**PrintNightmare**" vulnerability.

We create a user who will be an administrator.

![](11.png)

We connect to **evil-winrm**, we see that we are administrators and we read the flag of *root.txt*.
